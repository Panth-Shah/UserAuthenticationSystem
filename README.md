# UserAuthenticationSystem

Account Creation:
As a new user, 
I want to create an account with the Acme Drone Delivery Service if I do not already have one.  
In order to do so, I must provide my first name, family name, unique username which should be in an email address format, a password at least 10 characters in length and containing one digit, one uppercase character, one special character within the following set [&^%$#@]. 
I must confirm my password.
I also need to provide my postal address such that the service can deliver goods to my home via a very big drone.

Login:
As an existing user, I want to log into the Acme Drone Delivery Service. 
In order to do so, I must enter my username and my password. 
Upon successful login, I should be able to see and optionally modify my account information as entered during the account creation user story.
